## **Purpose**

The purpose of this portfolio is to showcase my coding and creative capabilities, whilst promoting my character, personality and skillset to potential employers.

## **Functionality / Features**

The overall look of this portfolio was to come across as a search engine looking up my profile. I also wanted the website to appear as if in the form of a Mac or Microsoft computer with the incorporation of the File, Edit, View, History and Profile buttons featured along the header of the desktop view and collapsed for a dropdown in mobile view.

The home page features a header listing the different pages with an active class on the tab that the user is on. This page also features a 'search-engine' in the centre that has a logo I designed followed by a typing container that has an animation attached to look as if the user is typing my details into the search bar, and a search button (magnifying glass) being clicked upon directly after the typing effect.
The search button also links to the Profile page as a 'search' feature. 
The footer has 3 links as a shortcut to see my other social media and make contact via email.

My Edit page is my Blogs link and features my the same mobile/desktop header functions. It contains five cards across the page in desktop view. This collapses to a flex-wrap and then flex direction: column as the screen shrinks.
The blog cards make use of the hover function to increase the display upon hovering over each one. Each blog card features an image referencing the blog feature and is linked to it's own blog page upon click.
The Edit page also features the same social media footer as seen on the home page, which can now be accessed via the 'File' button.

The blog pages within the edit link open to a page with a full image version and follow with the sub-heading of the blog and the post beneath.
The footer on the blog pages has a simple return link to navigate back to the original Blogs (Edit) page.

The View page has a contact form centred in the page which has inputs for first and last name featured on the first line, email and contact for the second line and a message input for the third. These all collapse into one column when reducing the screen size. There is a submit button below these inputs that becomes a different colour when hovered over. As this page's primary use is for contact, I've made the social media links for prominent and are located in a more central area.

The history page is a record of past work, studies and extra-curricular activities. It uses a pagination to navigate between the three different tabs, showing which is active upon each tab. It also features the same search container and click button as the home page, but the button on this page links back to the home page instead. The search container also has a blinking animation on the end of the typed name to add to the overall search engine look. 
The footer on this page is has a solid bar featuring a PDF link to my resume mockup.
The profile page uses the same search container and link system as the History page. It also has a colour change upon hover of the header text, as if clicking on a hyperlink that would be found in a 'search results' page. It has a short biography alongside my profile image. The footer returns to having a social media focus as featured on the File and Edit pages.
